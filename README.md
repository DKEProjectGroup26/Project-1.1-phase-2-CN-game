# Project-1.1-phase-2-CN-game

THIS IS THE MAIN CODE, PLEASE DON'T DUMP HERE

UPDATES:

 - I added some compilation instructions for MacOS, I can't figure out how to do it on Windows. I used this:(https://stackoverflow.com/a/5194940/7324619) answer from StackOverflow and it has a Windows part so if anyone with a Windows computer wants to try it, feel free (and please add instructions if you manage).

WHAT THIS IS:

 - For now only the windowing system
 - It's unfinished but it's stable

TO DO:

 - Graphics / clicking interface (Pietro)
 - File selection (Vishnu)
 - Random graph generation (Justus)
 - Node placement (Justus)
 - Other stuff (please add)
